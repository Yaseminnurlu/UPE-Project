# UPE-Project
For my project I decided to use CSS, JS and HTML to create a portfolio. Clicking on the header (which is my name) should open my linkedin account. Clicking on biography, extracurriculars, experience, and projects should open separate pages with paragraphs describing their topics. Clicking on the GitHub picture should give you the SSH code for a git repository with a previous project that I have done.

I would like to let you know that I have NEVER used CSS, JS and HTML before in my life, so I apologize if my code is not very neat.

To run the code, you have to download the files to VSCode and download an extension called Live Server. Once you do that, right click on the index.html file and click on "Open with Live Server". When it opens in your browser you should have full access to it.
